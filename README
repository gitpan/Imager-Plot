This module requires Imager 0.38 or newer to be installed on the
target machine.  

The pod Documentation is ALMOST ALL WRONG.  To see the usable part of the
api look at the test.pl script.

Everything is in complete disarray, but someone said release soon and
often (which sounds kind of strange since it will obviously be complete
trash).

Enjoy!
