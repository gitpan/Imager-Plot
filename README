This module usually requires the latest release version of Imager to be
installed on the target machine.  

The pod Documentation is getting better but is not finished.
It may be a good idea to look in the samples diretory and pick things 
up from there.

There is also a small DWIM (do what I mean) plot app named plot.pl 
in the distribution.

Thanks to Mengwong (Freeside) for providing the Tufte trilogy of
books on visual presentation.  Tufte is a genius on the subject and
the books rocks!


Enjoy!
