This module usually requires the latest release version of Imager to
be installed on the target machine and be capable to use some of the
font renderers that Imager supports, see Imager::Files manpage on
querying what file formats your installation supports.

The pod Documentation is getting better but is not finished.  It may
be a good idea to look in the samples diretory and pick things up from
there.  The samples are designed to run from the toplevel directory of
the distribution like so:

$ samples/sample1.pl 


There is also a small DWIM (do what I mean) plot app named plot.pl in
the distribution.

Thanks to Mengwong (Freeside) for providing the Tufte trilogy of books
on visual presentation.  Tufte is a genius on the subject and the
books rock!


Enjoy!
